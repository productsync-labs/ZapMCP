# Upstash Redis Docs

> Find the code for this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/productsync-labs/zapmcp/tree/main/examples/code-examples).

## Preparing Example Projects

First, we need to convert our example projects into a digestible format. For compatibility, the `addCodeExamples` method accepts a directory as its parameter. When called, it reads all the markdown files in that directory and treats each file as a sample project.

Upstash provides several example projects, as shown in their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/upstash/redis-js/tree/main/examples). To convert these projects into markdown files, some preprocessing is needed. The [zapmcp repository](https://github.com/productsync-labs/zapmcp/blob/main/examples/code-examples/src/prepare.ts) contains a simple script that goes through each project and bundles code until it reaches 500 lines. This process results in the following files for the Upstash Redis project:

```
auto-pipeline.md
aws-cdk-python.md
aws-cdk-typescript.md
azure-functions.md
cloudflare-workers-with-typescript.md
cloudflare-workers.md
deno.md
ion.md
nextjs-app-router.md
nextjs-pages-router.md
sst-v2.md
vercel-functions-app-router.md
vercel-functions-pages-router.md
with-sentry.md
```

## Serving the Markdown Files

After creating these markdown files, simply call the method to serve them. Use the `addCodeExamples` method as shown below:

```typescript
// Add docs for Upstash Redis
await server.addCodeExamples({
  name: "upstashExamples",
  description: `Get code examples from the Upstash Redis examples directory.
    If no specific example name is provided, it lists all available examples.
    If an example name is provided, it returns the full source code of that example.`,
  examplesDir: "contents/code-examples",
});
