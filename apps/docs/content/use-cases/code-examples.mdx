# Code Examples
Often times libraries and services ship with several code examples. These examples are very important for understanding the capabilities of a library, framework, or API service. By bundling the code examples with your MCP server you'll be able to discover all the following using agents from your IDE:
- Complete project structures
- Implementation patterns
- Best practices

AI agents perform significantly better when they have access to recent, working code. Static documentation from training can become outdated quickly, but bundled examples reflect the latest APIs, idioms, and real-world use cases. When AI has access to current code snippets, it can generate more accurate suggestions, and provide context-aware help thatâ€™s grounded in how the system is actually used.
