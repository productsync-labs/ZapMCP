# Welcome to ⚡️ ZapMCP

ZapMCP is a local-first framework for building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for coding agents. Using these servers, you can provide direct access to the complete knowledge base of your library in Cursor, Windsurf, Cody, or any other IDE that supports MCP.

Think of it as `@types/node` but for AI Agents.

Still unclear? You can find a more detailed answer on [why use a mcp server](/guides/why-use-mcp) for coding agents.
